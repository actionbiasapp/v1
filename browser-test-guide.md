# 🧪 Browser Testing Guide - LLM Integration

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

1. **✅ Duplicate Chat Messages** - Fixed redundant responses
2. **✅ Smart Currency Detection** - Assumes USD but allows correction
3. **✅ Holdings Disappearing** - Added scroll management to prevent items from hiding
4. **✅ Better Error Handling** - Improved clarification requests
5. **✅ Position Management** - Can reduce/increase existing holdings
6. **✅ Fuzzy Symbol Matching** - Handles misspellings and partial matches

```
http://localhost:3000
```
